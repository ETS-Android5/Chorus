1
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:07,783
We are young!

2
00:00:07,787 --> 00:00:09,882
But we have heart 

3
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:13,282
Born in this world as
it all falls apart

4
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:15,216
We are strong

5
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:17,200
But we don't belong

6
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:22,067
Born in this world as
it all falls apart

7
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:29,961
I see the children in the rain

8
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:31,761
Like the parade before the pain

9
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:33,533
I see the love, I see the hate,

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,441
I see this world that we can make

11
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:37,186
I see the life, I see the sky,

12
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,988
Give it all to see you fly...

13
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,998
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred,

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,824
But you're the ones who made it

15
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,171
Watch the beauty of all our lies passing right before my eyes

16
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,167
I hear the hate in all your words,

17
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:49,736
All the wars to make us hurt

18
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,454
We get so sick oh so sick

19
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:53,386
We never wanted all this

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,667
Medication for the kids with no reason to live

21
00:00:56,668 --> 00:01:00,350
So we march to the drums of the damned as we come

22
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,383
Watch it burn in the sun — we are numb

23
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:05,232
We are young!

24
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,100
But we have heart 

25
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:10,949
Born in this world as
it all falls apart 

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,333
We are strong

27
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,233
But we don't belong

28
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:18,517
Born in this world as
it all falls apart

29
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:20,933
And we walk among these shadows, in these streets,

30
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,150
This fields of battle

31
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:23,783
Take it up, we wear the medals,

32
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,650
Raise your hands with burning candles

33
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:27,517
Hear us whisper in the dark,

34
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:29,283
In the rain you see the spark

35
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:31,067
Feel the beating of our hearts,

36
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:32,767
Fleeting hope as we depart

37
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:36,467
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known

38
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,292
All we've ever really wanted

39
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:39,767
Was a place to call our home

40
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:43,429
But you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts

41
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,239
Made to kneel before the alter

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,810
As you tear us apart

43
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:50,456
So we march to the drums of the damned as we come

44
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,730
Watch it burn in the sun — we are numb

45
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:57,300
We are young, We are far

46
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:00,950
Born in this world as
it all falls apart

47
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:04,733
We are strong, We don't belong

48
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:08,750
Born in this world as
it all falls apart

49
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:12,183
We will fight or we will fall

50
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:15,650
Till the angels save us all

51
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:19,617
We will fight or we will fall

52
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:23,150
Till the angels save us all

53
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:27,034
We will fight or we will fall

54
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:31,050
Till the angels save us all

55
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,417
We will fight or we will fall

56
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:37,650
Till the angels save us all

57
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:41,006
We are young, We are far

58
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:44,518
Born in this world as
it all falls apart

59
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,294
We are strong, We don't belong

60
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:51,769
Born in this world as
it all falls apart

61
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,485
We are young, We are far

62
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:59,116
Born in this world as
it all falls apart

63
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:02,599
We are strong, We don't belong

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,633
Born in this world as
it all falls apart
